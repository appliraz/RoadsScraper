# RoadsScraper
A custom script that I've made to get, from two major Israeli roads constructions companies, their announcements on today's planned constructions to my email.

To use this script yourself you'll need a sender email and an app password (please search online to learn more about app password)

In emailSender.py you can update the constants on the page head accordingly and then run main.py

Currently the scraped websites are https://ayalonhw.co.il/ and https://www.iroads.co.il/

Personally I use Task Scheduler on Windows to run this script daily

Written in Python 3.8
